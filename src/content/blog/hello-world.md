# Hello World!

Welcome to my new blog! This is my first post, and I'm excited to start sharing my thoughts and experiences here.

## What to Expect

I'll be writing about:

- **Technology** — exploring new tools and frameworks
- **Projects** — documenting my work and learnings
- **Ideas** — sharing thoughts on various topics

## Why Astro?

I chose [Astro](https://astro.build) for this blog because:

1. It's perfect for content-focused sites
2. Markdown support is first-class
3. The build output is fast static HTML
4. Easy deployment to GitHub Pages

Stay tuned for more content!
